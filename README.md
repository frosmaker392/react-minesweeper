# React Minesweeper

A small project for me to apply my knowledge of React and learn new things with it. I also experimented with Neomorphism as a graphic style, although I still haven't done any work on theming at the moment. Please note that this application might not showcase the best of code practices, so it should not be taken as a good example of a React project in general. This project is currently deployed at Vercel via the following link:
